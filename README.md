implementation of design patterns in java

creational design patterns
singleton pattern - Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

decorator pattern - Attaches additional responsibility to an object dynamically, provides flexible alternative to 
   subclassing for extending functionality.
   
command pattern - encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different
   requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

adapter pattern - converts the interface of a class into another interface that client expects. adapter lets classes 
   work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interface.
   
facade pattern - provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher level
   interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
   
template method pattern - defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclass.
   Template Method lets subclass redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
