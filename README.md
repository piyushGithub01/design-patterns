# design-patterns
implementation of design patterns in java

creational design patterns
singleton pattern - Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.


decorator pattern - Attaches additional responsibility to an object dynamically, provides flexible alternative to 
   subclassing for extending functionality.
   
command pattern - encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different
   requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
